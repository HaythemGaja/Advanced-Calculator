Use the on-screen buttons or your keyboard to input your mathematical expression.

The result will update live at the bottom of the display.

Press the = button or the Enter key to finalize the calculation and add it to the history.

Using the History Panel:

Technologies Used
HTML5: For the structure and content of the application.

CSS3 & Tailwind CSS: For a modern, responsive, and utility-first styling approach.

Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+): For all the calculator logic, DOM manipulation, and event handling. No external frameworks or libraries are needed for the core functionality.

Future Improvements
Scientific Functions: Add trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan), logarithms (log), and constants like Pi (π).

Themes: Implement a theme switcher for light and dark modes.

Local Storage: Persist the calculation history in the browser's local storage so it's saved across sessions.

Unit Conversions: Add a mode for converting between different units (e.g., length, weight, temperature).
